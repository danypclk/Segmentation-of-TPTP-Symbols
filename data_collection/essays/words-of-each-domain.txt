Algebraic structures often revolve around operations such as addition, multiplication, and the examination of how these operations behave under various axioms. In commutative rings, for instance, both addition and multiplication must be associative and the ring must have a multiplicative identity. A classic example is the ring of integers, where we explore divisibility, units, and zero divisors. In more specialized contexts, we study integral domains, which are commutative rings with no zero divisors, laying the foundation for investigating polynomial rings like. Within these polynomial rings, questions of factorization, greatest common divisors GCDs, and irreducible polynomials often arise.
Moving from rings to fields, we insist that every nonzero element possesses a multiplicative inverse, leading to deeper pursuits in field extensions, field automorphisms, and the classification of finite fields such as . In group theory, we delve into groups with axioms of associativity, identity, and invertibility. Abelian groups are those whose group operation is commutative, and more nuanced investigation covers concepts like normal subgroups, simple groups, and the Jordan–Hölder theorem.
Furthermore, homomorphisms between algebraic structures preserve the underlying operation(s), unlocking possibilities like the isomorphism theorems, which reveal close relationships between quotients and substructures. Across these studies, one frequently encounters sophisticated theorems like Lagrange’s theorem for finite groups, asserting that the order of any subgroup divides the order of the group, or the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, stating that every nonconstant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. These concepts, together with matrix algebra, module theory, and linear transformations in vector spaces, anchor the broad domain of algebra as represented in many TPTP problems.
Number theory primarily concerns the properties of integers and rational numbers. A core concept is divisibility, which leads to the detailed study of prime numbers, composite numbers, and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which states that every integer greater than 1 can be factorized uniquely (up to ordering) into a product of prime factors. Such factorizations interact with greatest common divisors (gcd) and least common multiples (lcm), which are essential in diophantine equations and many basic problem setups.
More advanced topics include modular arithmetic, where for a positive integer , we consider equivalence classes of integers under congruence mod. This viewpoint enables the use of results like Fermat’s little theorem, Euler’s theorem, and the Chinese remainder theorem, each offering insight into solving congruences and understanding the structure of units in rings like.
In additive number theory, we tackle questions like the Goldbach conjecture or the Waring’s problem, examining representations of integers as sums of powers.
At the more profound level, modern number theory looks into algebraic number fields, Galois theory, and the study of class groups and units in rings of algebraic integers. Problems can also involve transcendental numbers, like and , or delve into the geometry of numbers, investigating lattice points and Minkowski’s theorem in convex bodies. These advanced perspectives on integers and their generalizations frequently appear in TPTP test problems aiming to probe the boundaries of automated reasoning in arithmetic domains.
Set theory underpins much of modern mathematics, addressing the nature of sets, elements, and their relationships through concepts such as membership (, subset relations, and fundamental operations like union, intersection, set difference, and complement. A set can be finite, countably infinite, or uncountable, giving rise to intriguing explorations of cardinalities and the related arithmetic of infinite sets, and .
In axiomatic set theory, the standard approach involves ZFC Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice, which establishes a foundation for almost all of classical mathematics. Core ZFC axioms, such as Extensionality, Separation, Replacement, and Infinity, lay out rules about what sets exist and how they can be formed. Controversial (or at least heavily debated) statements like the Continuum Hypothesis highlight the intricacies of infinite sets and the layered structure of the infinite cardinal numbers.
Ordinal numbers and cardinal numbers are special sets that encode well-ordered types and sizes of sets, respectively. Transfinite recursion on ordinals provides a mechanism for defining functions on ever-larger classes of objects, while rank hierarchies (e.g., the von Neumann hierarchy) illustrate how sets can be organized in cumulative stages. TPTP problems in set theory might ask a theorem prover to handle set membership relations, prove subset properties, or demonstrate the consistency or inconsistency of certain theories.
Combinatorics is the mathematics of counting, arranging, and analyzing discrete structures. At its core, one encounters familiar topics such as permutations and combinations, with foundational formulas like.
These lay the groundwork for advanced combinatorial identities involving binomial coefficients, multinomial coefficients, and associated generating functions. Beyond mere counting, combinatorics investigates partitions, combinatorial designs, block designs, and advanced subjects like Ramsey theory, which asserts that sufficiently large structures inevitably contain certain substructures.
Key theorems like the Pigeonhole Principle show up in a surprising variety of proofs, guaranteeing that if you place items into fewer than containers, some container must hold more than one item. Meanwhile, the inclusion-exclusion principle handles overlapping sets of possibilities by systematically adding and subtracting intersecting cardinalities. In graph theory, a major branch of combinatorics, we use concepts such as vertices, edges, planarity, and graph colorings (like chromatic number). Eulerian and Hamiltonian paths highlight structural intricacies of graphs, while advanced topics include tree enumerations ( Cayley’s formula) and matchings in bipartite graphs.
Automated theorem-proving tasks in combinatorics might require a system to reason about enumerating structures, establishing upper or lower bounds for particular configurations, or verifying properties of certain combinatorial designs. The domain is rich with both combinational complexity and elegant solutions, which is why combinatorics often features within TPTP libraries.
Geometry spans a wide range of notions about space, shapes, and transformations, beginning with Euclid’s Elements and the axioms of Euclidean geometry. Problems might involve lines, angles, circles, and triangles, along with their classic properties like congruence, similarity, midpoints, and centroids. Beyond traditional Euclidean constructions, geometry delves into non-Euclidean systems—such as hyperbolic and elliptic geometry—where parallel lines behave in unconventional ways, prompting a reevaluation of fundamental theorems and definitions.
Analytic geometry uses the coordinate plane to describe geometric objects via equations and inequalities. Thus, lines become linear equations, circles become conic sections, and transformations like rotations, reflections, and translations can be captured as matrix operations in affine transformations. In more advanced contexts, differential geometry considers smooth manifolds and employs tools from calculus to explore curvature, geodesics, and topological invariants. Meanwhile, projective geometry addresses the geometry of transformations where parallel lines meet at a point at infinity, unifying certain Euclidean and non-Euclidean phenomena under a single framework.
Automated theorem provers in geometry often rely on synthetic or coordinate approaches to solve proof problems, verifying classical statements like Ceva’s theorem, Menelaus’s theorem, or Pascal’s theorem. The TPTP tasks can include verifying a given geometric configuration, checking concurrency or collinearity of points, or exploring advanced geometric loci using algebraic methods.
Logic encompasses the formal study of reasoning, from propositional (Boolean) logic to first-order and higher-order theories. Propositional logic utilizes variables that can be either true or false, combined using connectives like . The core results include tautologies, satisfiability, logical equivalences, and canonical forms such as conjunctive normal form (CNF) and disjunctive normal form (DNF).
Predicate logic (first-order logic) extends propositional logic to allow quantifiers for universal and for existential—applied to variables over some domain. It also introduces predicate symbols, function symbols, and constant symbols, which represent mathematical objects and relationships. Key theorems in first-order logic include Completeness (Gödel’s completeness theorem, stating that syntactic derivability and semantic truth coincide for first-order theories) and Compactness (every unsatisfiable set of first-order sentences has a finite unsatisfiable subset). Higher-order logic further enhances expressiveness by allowing quantification over sets, relations, and even functions themselves.
In automated theorem proving, unification—the process of finding substitutions to make logical expressions identical—is fundamental. Resolution-based methods reduce problems to refutations by contradiction, while tableaux methods systematically search for contradictions through tree expansions. Model checking and decision procedures also appear, especially in propositional logic, where SAT solvers check the satisfiability of Boolean formulas, employing advanced algorithms like DPLL or CDCL. Logic forms the heart of TPTP, with a broad array of test problems from propositional tautologies to intricate higher-order statements in mathematics.
Mathematical analysis studies concepts like limits, continuity, convergence, and differentiation. Real analysis focuses on functions 
and sequences  in the real numbers. Defining a limit rigorously involves epsilon-delta criteria, capturing the intuition that a function approaches a particular value as the input grows close to some point. Continuity similarly relies on the same conditions. In complex analysis, functions become more structured; holomorphic (complex-differentiable) functions exhibit powerful properties like the Cauchy integral formula, and entire functions follow expansions via power series.
Integral calculus investigates areas under curves, volumes, and more general measures of accumulation, with the Riemann integral as a starting point in elementary courses. Lebesgue integration refines this notion, handling more complicated sets and functions, and bridging to measure theory. Advanced real analysis covers topics such as uniform convergence, series of functions, Fourier analysis, Laplace transforms, and differential equations—both ordinary (ODEs) and partial (PDEs).
In TPTP contexts, analysis problems can as for proofs of theorems about convergent sequences, properties of continuous functions, or relationships among integrals and derivatives. While automated theorem provers handle discrete logic most naturally, specialized techniques can tackle real-valued equalities or inequalities by combining symbolic and numeric methods. Formal verification of well-known results (like the Intermediate Value Theorem, the Mean Value Theorem, or the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus) underscores the challenge of bridging discrete logic with the continuum of real numbers.
Algebra comprises the study of structures and operations such as addition, multiplication, and their interactions under various sets of axioms. In basic algebraic contexts, one frequently encounters groups, rings, and fields. A group is a set equipped with a single binary operation that is associative and admits an identity element and inverses for every element. When the group operation is commutative, the group is called abelian, exemplified by the additive group of integers. In more advanced group theory, concepts of subgroups, normal subgroups, factor groups, and group homomorphisms arise. These ideas connect to fundamental theorems, such as the Jordan-Holder theorem, which concerns how a group can be broken down into simple groups through composition series.
Beyond groups, rings and fields explore two binary operations, typically referred to as addition and multiplication. A ring is a set where both addition and multiplication are defined and satisfy axioms like associativity. If multiplication is also commutative, then we speak of a commutative ring. The ring of integers is a standard example, while polynomial rings and rings of matrices add complexity to the theory. Integral domains are commutative rings that have no zero divisors, paving the way for further exploration of divisibility theory, factorization, irreducible elements, and units. Fields are rings where every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse, and this property underpins much of higher algebra, including field extensions, splitting fields, and Galois theory. Algebra also encompasses modules over rings, vector spaces over fields, linear maps, and matrix theory, offering a rich terrain of structures that underlie many areas of mathematics.
Number theory focuses on properties of integers, prime and composite numbers, factorization, and a host of fundamental theorems that shape the landscape of discrete mathematics. At the foundational level, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every integer larger than 1 can be expressed as a unique product of primes, up to ordering of the factors. From this basis, one studies greatest common divisors, least common multiples, and their relationships to linear combinations of integers, encapsulated by Bezout's identity. Prime number theory delves into questions of distribution of primes, prime gaps, and conjectures like Goldbach's conjecture.Set theory underlies virtually every branch of mathematics. It begins with the notion of a set as a collection of distinct objects, leading to operations such as union, intersection, set difference, and complement. Relations like membership and subset are central, and discussions about finite, countably infinite, and uncountably infinite sets bring forward the concept of different sizes or cardinalities of infinity. The arithmetic of cardinal numbers reveals that infinite sets follow unexpected rules, such as the ability to pair the natural numbers with their squares, suggesting that both sets have the same cardinality.
Modern mathematics often adopts the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms with the Axiom of Choice, collectively called ZFC, as a foundational framework. These axioms formalize principles like Extensionality, which states that two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements, and Replacement, which governs how new sets can be formed by applying definable functions to existing sets. The Axiom of Choice remains a crucial tool in many proofs, although it has been historically controversial. When examining well-ordered collections, one arrives at the concept of ordinal numbers, which classify sets by order types. Cardinal numbers measure the sizes of sets, and famous questions like the Continuum Hypothesis ask whether there is a cardinal strictly between the cardinality of the natural numbers and the cardinality of the real numbers. These set-theoretic inquiries form the backbone of foundational research and inform a wide variety of mathematical investigations.
A key component of number theory involves modular arithmetic, where one considers congruence classes of integers modulo a positive integer. This approach is essential in solving linear congruences and exploring cyclic groups of units in the rings of integers modulo n. Notable results include Fermat's little theorem, which states that if p is prime and a is not divisible by p, then a raised to the power p minus 1 is congruent to 1 modulo p. Another important theorem is Euler's theorem, which generalizes the same idea using the Euler totient function. When the scope broadens to algebraic number theory, one studies number fields, class groups, units in rings of algebraic integers, and deeper questions that link field extensions and factorization properties. Number theory also extends to diophantine equations, which ask for integer solutions to polynomial equations, sometimes leading to famous problems such as Fermat's Last Theorem or the search for integral points on elliptic curves.
Combinatorics revolves around counting, arranging, and analyzing discrete structures. At an elementary level, students learn about permutations, which count the ways to order objects, and combinations, which count the ways to select objects without regard to order. Such basic principles expand to more sophisticated tools, including the inclusion-exclusion principle, which calculates the size of a union of sets by adding the sizes of the sets individually and then subtracting out overlaps. The pigeonhole principle appears in many surprising contexts and simply states that if you try to place more items than there are containers, at least one container must hold multiple items.
Branching off from basic enumeration, combinatorics delves into theory-rich areas such as Ramsey theory, which demonstrates that sufficiently large structures inevitably exhibit certain regular patterns, and extremal set theory, where one seeks upper or lower bounds on the sizes of certain collections. Generating functions supply powerful methods to encode sequences and manipulate them to count complex objects, including partitions of integers and various restricted arrangements. A significant part of combinatorics also overlaps with graph theory. Here, one studies vertices and edges, looking at path existence, tree structures, matchings, colorings, or planarity criteria. These subjects often push combinatorial reasoning to its limits, highlighting intricate structural arguments and combinatorial explosions that challenge even the most sophisticated counting techniques.
Geometry encompasses the study of shapes, angles, lines, distances, and transformations in space. Classical Euclidean geometry is built on postulates that govern parallel lines, congruence, and similarity, leading to well-known theorems such as the Pythagorean theorem, Thales theorem, or the sum of angles in a triangle. Explorations in geometry have evolved beyond flat Euclidean space, moving into non-Euclidean geometries like hyperbolic and elliptic geometry, where the notion of parallel lines or curvature shifts dramatically, giving rise to alternate models of space and different angle-sum properties in triangles.
Analytic geometry employs coordinates to represent points and uses algebraic equations to characterize lines, conic sections, and higher-dimensional surfaces. In this approach, transformations such as rotations, reflections, and translations can be expressed using matrices, linking geometric arguments to linear algebra. More advanced developments include projective geometry, which adds points at infinity to treat parallel lines as intersecting in an extended plane, and differential geometry, which studies smooth curves, surfaces, and manifolds by employing tools from calculus. Geometry problems in automated theorem proving may ask for proofs of concurrency (when lines meet in a single point), collinearity (when points lie on the same line), circle properties, or the verification of specific configurations. Many classical results, such as Ceva's theorem or Menelaus's theorem, remain popular targets for synthetic and coordinate-based proofs alike.
Logic investigates the principles of valid reasoning, providing a formal language to express mathematical statements and proofs. In propositional logic, one examines formulas built from propositional variables that can be true or false, combined with connectives like and, or, not, implies. Key objectives include determining which formulas are tautologies, which are satisfiable, and which are contradictions. Canonical forms, such as conjunctive normal form and disjunctive normal form, help organize formulas in ways that are conducive to algorithmic analysis, often via SAT solvers.
Predicate logic, also called first-order logic, broadens the scope by allowing quantified variables and predicate symbols that can express relationships between objects in a domain of discourse. The presence of universal and existential quantifiers, alongside function symbols and constants, creates a vastly more expressive language. Fundamental theorems of first-order logic include the Completeness theorem, which shows that derivability and semantic entailment coincide, and the Compactness theorem, which states that if a set of sentences is unsatisfiable, then there is a finite subset that is also unsatisfiable. Methods such as unification and resolution have been developed to automate the process of deriving contradictions in first-order logic, forming the backbone of many automated theorem provers. Higher-order logic further permits quantification over predicates and functions, offering even more expressive power at the cost of increased complexity in proof search.
Analysis deals with concepts of limits, continuity, differentiability, and integrals. Real analysis concentrates on functions defined on the real numbers, sequences of real numbers, and series expansions. Essential definitions include the epsilon-delta formulation of limits, which captures the notion of a function or sequence approaching a particular value. Continuous functions are those that preserve closeness of input and output, while differentiable functions have well-defined rates of change captured by the derivative. The field also addresses convergence of infinite series, uniform convergence of sequences of functions, and more abstract concepts like metric spaces, which generalize notions of distance.
In complex analysis, one studies functions that take complex numbers as inputs and outputs. The concept of complex differentiability leads to powerful results, including the Cauchy integral theorem and residue calculus, which are unparalleled in real analysis. The presence of complex conjugation, real and imaginary parts, and analytic continuations all play significant roles. Integrals are also central to analysis; the Riemann integral is sufficient for many elementary tasks, though the Lebesgue integral refines the notion by measuring sets in more flexible ways. This merges analysis with measure theory and provides a foundation for areas like functional analysis, which deals with spaces of functions and linear operators acting upon them. These tools become indispensable for the study of partial differential equations, Fourier transforms, and many advanced subjects that rely on rigorous treatments of infinite processes.
Outside the core domains, many additional topics find representation in TPTP-style problems. Graph theory examines properties of finite and infinite graphs, exploring adjacency, connectivity, bipartite matchings, and problems of graph isomorphism. Topology investigates continuous deformations of spaces, emphasizing open sets, closed sets, compactness, connectedness, and homeomorphisms. Questions about path connectivity or classification of surfaces fall under this umbrella, and the language of open coverings and continuity is intimately linked to analysis.
Modal and temporal logics extend classical logic to reason about necessity, possibility, time, and change. Modal logics use accessibility relations between possible worlds, while temporal logics incorporate time-steps or intervals, allowing statements like eventually or always. In computer science and software verification, one often encounters logics for data structures such as lists, trees, and heaps, combined with techniques like Hoare logic to prove correctness of programs. Each of these specialized fields has its own terminology, axioms, and standard results, adding to the wealth of challenging test problems in automated reasoning systems.
Algebra investigates structures and operations that generalize arithmetic and symmetry. Central to this domain are concepts of groups, rings, and fields, each endowed with axiomatic rules that govern how elements and operations behave. In group theory, one encounters the definition of a group as a set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, and inverses for all elements. Abelian or commutative groups require that the group operation commute, as in the case of integer addition. Many fundamental results, such as Lagranges theorem, specify how subgroup orders must divide group orders. Subgroups, normal subgroups, cosets, and factor groups shape the internal organization of groups, while homomorphisms and isomorphisms describe structural transformations between different groups. The classification of finite simple groups, one of the major achievements in mathematics, exemplifies the depth and complexity of group theory.
Rings extend the group concept by adding a second operation, generally thought of as multiplication. A ring must support an additive group structure and a multiplicative operation that is associative, but rings need not always have a multiplicative identity or invertible elements. If the ring is commutative and has an identity, one studies integral domains, which disallow zero divisors, and fields, where every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. Fields offer a robust setting for linear algebra through the structure of vector spaces, where linear transformations preserve vector addition and scalar multiplication. In deeper layers, polynomials, factorization, prime elements, and unique factorization domains drive many of the theorems in both classical and modern algebra. Galois theory explores symmetries of field extensions, linking group actions on field elements to solvability of polynomials. Beyond these classical topics, algebraic geometry, representation theory, module theory, and category theory further expand the algebraic landscape, reflecting the remarkable breadth and unity within this domain.
Number theory is devoted to the study of integers, integer solutions of equations, and properties of prime numbers. Its fundamental bedrock is the unique factorization theorem, also known as the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every integer greater than one can be factored uniquely into primes, ignoring the order of factors. Properties of divisibility, greatest common divisors, and least common multiples are analyzed using these prime factors, and can be used to solve linear Diophantine equations in two or more variables. Congruences, an essential tool, involve reducing integers modulo a fixed base, enabling arithmetic in rings like the set of integers modulo n. This modular viewpoint undergirds key classical results, such as Fermats little theorem and the more general Eulers theorem, linking properties of exponentiation to the Euler totient function.
In addition to modular arithmetic, number theorists delve into analytic number theory and algebraic number theory. Analytic approaches use tools from real and complex analysis to probe the distribution of primes, leading to proofs of the prime number theorem or partial progress on conjectures like the Riemann hypothesis. Algebraic number theory introduces number fields, ring of integers, class groups, and Galois extensions, investigating how prime factorization works in extensions of the rational numbers. One also encounters elliptic curves, which represent solutions to certain cubic equations and relate to deep conjectures and theorems connecting rational points and arithmetic geometry. Diophantine problems can range from elementary puzzles to highly advanced equations like those relating to Catalans conjecture or Fermats last theorem, illustrating the continuous interplay between fundamental integer properties and profound theoretical questions.
Set theory serves as a foundational framework for mathematics, analyzing collections of objects called sets. Basic operations include union, intersection, and set difference, while key relations include membership and the subset relationship. Distinctions between finite and infinite sets, alongside the recognition of countable and uncountable infinities, highlight the varying sizes or cardinalities that sets can possess. Classic examples are the set of natural numbers, which is countably infinite, and the real numbers, which form an uncountable set.

Modern set theory is usually framed within Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice, abbreviated as ZFC. Axioms such as Extensionality, Separation, and Replacement define how sets may be constructed and how they are recognized as equal. The Axiom of Infinity asserts the existence of inductive sets, making infinite sets integral to mathematics. The Axiom of Choice, historically debated, implies powerful consequences such as Zorns lemma and the well-ordering theorem. The organization of sets into hierarchies like the von Neumann universe reveals a cumulative build-up where each rank is formed by taking the power set of the previous rank. Ordinal numbers formalize the notion of well-ordered sequences and transfinite recursion, while cardinal numbers measure a sets size. Questions like the Continuum Hypothesis query the relationship between the cardinality of the natural numbers and the cardinality of the continuum, reflecting deep insight into the structure of infinite sets.

Combinatorics focuses on counting arrangements, configurations, and structures in discrete settings. Elementary techniques include permutations, which count the ways to order distinct objects, and combinations, which count ways to select objects without regard to order. Additional tools include the inclusion-exclusion principle to account for overlapping sets, the pigeonhole principle to guarantee collisions when items outnumber containers, and generating functions to systematically encode and manipulate counting sequences. More specialized topics, such as partition functions, consider ways to express integers as sums of natural numbers under various constraints.

Graph theory forms a major branch of combinatorics, examining vertices connected by edges and exploring properties like connectivity, bipartite matchings, planarity, colorings, and Eulerian or Hamiltonian cycles. Advanced results may involve Ramsey theory, which states that sufficiently large or dense networks inevitably exhibit certain substructures. Extremal combinatorics investigates maximum or minimum properties of combinatorial objects subject to constraints, while design theory examines balanced configurations of subsets with prescribed intersection properties, known as block designs. Together, these areas emphasize constructive arguments, double counting, combinatorial identities, and algorithmic methods that tackle the combinatorial explosion of possibilities in discrete mathematics.

Geometry covers the study of shape, size, distance, angles, and relative positions of figures. In classical Euclidean geometry, the cornerstone is the set of postulates attributed to Euclid, driving theorems such as the ones explaining triangle angle sums, circle theorems, and properties of similar or congruent figures. Non-Euclidean geometries, like hyperbolic and elliptic systems, arise by modifying Euclids parallel postulate, revealing that line geometry can vary drastically when curvature or other constraints are introduced.

Analytic geometry provides a powerful bridge by using coordinates to represent points in a plane or space, translating geometric problems into algebraic equations. Lines and conic sections, for instance, are defined by polynomials in x and y, while transformations like rotations and reflections can be captured through matrix multiplication. Projective geometry extends the plane by adding points at infinity, turning parallel lines into intersecting lines in an augmented geometric framework and simplifying certain incidence theorems. Differential geometry investigates curves, surfaces, and manifolds using the language of calculus, employing concepts like tangent spaces, curvature, and geodesics. This deeper understanding of geometry undergirds the study of modern physics, manifold theory, and topological properties that remain invariant under continuous deformations. Automated theorem proving in geometry might verify concurrency or collinearity or apply coordinate-based computations to confirm classical results like Cevas theorem.

Logic is the rigorous study of valid reasoning and formal languages used to describe mathematical statements. Propositional logic deals with formulas constructed from propositional variables using logical connectives such as and, or, not, implies, and equivalences like if and only if. These formulas evaluate to true or false and can be manipulated into normal forms like conjunctive normal form or disjunctive normal form, aiding in the process of determining tautologies, contradictions, or satisfiable statements. Satisfiability solvers for propositional logic form the backbone of many automated reasoning tools, particularly in computer science.

First-order logic, also called predicate logic, extends propositional logic by introducing quantifiers, such as there exists and for all, as well as predicate and function symbols that capture relationships between objects in a domain. Key results include Godels completeness theorem, which states that a set of first-order sentences is provable exactly when it is true in every model, and the compactness theorem, which says that if a set of formulas is unsatisfiable, then a finite subset is unsatisfiable. The method of resolution provides a mechanical approach to refutation, relying on unification to match terms in clauses. Higher-order logic, meanwhile, raises expressiveness by allowing quantification over predicates, functions, and sometimes sets. This expressiveness comes with increased complexity, but it enables more direct formalizations of complex mathematical statements. Logic remains fundamental to automated theorem proving, model checking, and the formal verification of software and hardware.

Analysis revolves around concepts of limits, convergence, continuity, and the rigorous underpinnings of calculus. Real analysis studies functions defined on the real numbers, where the epsilon-delta definition of limits and continuous functions ensures mathematical rigor in discussing infinitesimal changes. Sequences and series form another core topic, examining whether infinite sums converge or diverge, and under what conditions they converge absolutely or conditionally. Real analysis also addresses uniform convergence of sequences of functions, power series expansions, and an exploration of metric spaces, which abstract the notion of distance.

Complex analysis studies functions of a complex variable, where the concept of complex differentiability or holomorphicity imposes strong conditions that result in powerful theorems. The residue theorem, for instance, enables the evaluation of integrals around poles of meromorphic functions by examining local behavior of singularities. The geometry of the complex plane, featuring analytic continuation and conformal mappings, reveals surprising properties absent from purely real analysis. Measure theory generalizes the notion of length, area, and volume to more complicated subsets of real space, allowing for the development of the Lebesgue integral. This integral better handles pathological examples and underpins modern probability theory and functional analysis. In partial differential equations, one studies solutions to equations involving rates of change across multiple variables, bridging analysis with physics, geometry, and other applied fields.


Graph theory examines structures composed of vertices and edges, where edges capture connections between vertices. Fundamental notions include degrees of vertices, adjacency, and paths, which are sequences of edges linking distinct vertices. Graph connectivity divides a graph into connected components, while bipartite graphs disallow odd cycles. Matchings, especially in bipartite graphs, explore sets of edges without common vertices, connecting to applications in scheduling and network flows. Eulerian paths traverse every edge exactly once, and Hamiltonian cycles traverse every vertex exactly once, each exemplifying different breadths of path-based constraints.

Planar graphs can be drawn on a plane without edges crossing, and Kuratowskis theorem links planarity to forbidden subgraphs. Colorings and the chromatic number measure the minimum number of colors needed to color vertices so that no two adjacent vertices share a color, an area influenced by classical problems like the four color theorem for planar maps. Graph isomorphism, which investigates whether two graphs are structurally the same, forms a central question in complexity theory. Tree-based arguments consider acyclic connected graphs, focusing on counting spanning trees and investigating how trees form simpler backbones for more complex networks. Overall, graph theory provides a combinatorial framework that is pervasive across computer science, discrete optimization, social network analysis, and beyond.

Topology studies the qualitative properties of spaces that remain unchanged under continuous deformations such as stretching or bending, while disallowing tearing or gluing. Basic concepts include open sets, which underlie the definitions of continuity and convergence in topological spaces. Compactness captures the idea of sets that behave like closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space but within the broader spectrum of potentially abstract spaces. Connectedness and path connectedness probe whether sets can be split into disjoint open subsets or if they can be traversed by continuous paths without leaving the set.

Various specialized branches of topology explore different angles. Algebraic topology uses groups and rings to classify topological spaces, employing notions like the fundamental group or homology groups that measure holes in different dimensions. Differential topology focuses on smooth manifolds, where calculus tools apply to glean information about curvature and local or global geometry. Point-set topology, the foundation of modern topology, studies convergence, separation axioms, and continuous functions in great detail, often linking these ideas to the structure of metric spaces and other specialized topological constructs. Topology has far-reaching implications in areas like functional analysis, manifold theory, knot theory, and dynamical systems, illustrating how global qualitative features can drive sophisticated classifications.

Probability theory addresses the analysis of random phenomena and the quantification of uncertainty through measures assigned to events in a probability space. An event is typically defined as a subset of the sample space, and the probability measure assigns a real number between zero and one, capturing the likelihood that an event occurs. When the sample space is finite, probabilities may be as simple as counting favorable outcomes divided by total possible outcomes, but continuous distributions demand integration with probability density functions. Notable probability distributions include the uniform distribution on an interval, the normal (Gaussian) distribution, the exponential distribution, and discrete distributions such as the binomial or Poisson distributions.

Central concepts include independence, which indicates that events do not affect each others probabilities, and conditional probability, which modifies the probability of an event based on additional known outcomes. Expected value or mean provides the average result of a random variable, while variance measures the spread or dispersion around the mean. Important theorems, such as the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem, connect the behavior of independent identically distributed random variables to predictable long-term statistics. In stochastic processes, one studies sequences or families of random variables indexed by time or other sets, leading to models like Markov chains and Brownian motion, both of which have significant applications in fields like finance, physics, and biology.



Thought about extending domain texts for 11 seconds
Below you will find several extended texts in plain text, each focusing on a specific mathematical domain commonly represented in the TPTP library. No special symbols or bold characters are used, and each section is written to include a wide range of relevant terminology and concepts.

Central to this domain are concepts of groups, rings, and fields, each endowed with axiomatic rules that govern how elements and operations behave.

In addition to modular arithmetic, number theorists delve into analytic number theory and algebraic number theory. Analytic approaches use tools from real and complex analysis to probe the distribution of primes, leading to proofs of the prime number theorem or partial progress on conjectures like the Riemann hypothesis. Algebraic number theory introduces number fields, ring of integers, class groups, and Galois extensions, investigating how prime factorization works in extensions of the rational numbers. One also encounters elliptic curves, which represent solutions to certain cubic equations and relate to deep conjectures and theorems connecting rational points and arithmetic geometry. Diophantine problems can range from elementary puzzles to highly advanced equations like those relating to Catalans conjecture or Fermats last theorem, illustrating the continuous interplay between fundamental integer properties and profound theoretical questions.

Set theory serves as a foundational framework for mathematics, analyzing collections of objects called sets. Basic operations include union, intersection, and set difference, while key relations include membership and the subset relationship. Distinctions between finite and infinite sets, alongside the recognition of countable and uncountable infinities, highlight the varying sizes or cardinalities that sets can possess. Classic examples are the set of natural numbers, which is countably infinite, and the real numbers, which form an uncountable set.

Modern set theory is usually framed within Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice, abbreviated as ZFC. Axioms such as Extensionality, Separation, and Replacement define how sets may be constructed and how they are recognized as equal. The Axiom of Infinity asserts the existence of inductive sets, making infinite sets integral to mathematics. The Axiom of Choice, historically debated, implies powerful consequences such as Zorns lemma and the well-ordering theorem. The organization of sets into hierarchies like the von Neumann universe reveals a cumulative build-up where each rank is formed by taking the power set of the previous rank. Ordinal numbers formalize the notion of well-ordered sequences and transfinite recursion, while cardinal numbers measure a sets size. Questions like the Continuum Hypothesis query the relationship between the cardinality of the natural numbers and the cardinality of the continuum, reflecting deep insight into the structure of infinite sets.

Combinatorics focuses on counting arrangements, configurations, and structures in discrete settings. Elementary techniques include permutations, which count the ways to order distinct objects, and combinations, which count ways to select objects without regard to order. Additional tools include the inclusion-exclusion principle to account for overlapping sets, the pigeonhole principle to guarantee collisions when items outnumber containers, and generating functions to systematically encode and manipulate counting sequences. More specialized topics, such as partition functions, consider ways to express integers as sums of natural numbers under various constraints.

Graph theory forms a major branch of combinatorics, examining vertices connected by edges and exploring properties like connectivity, bipartite matchings, planarity, colorings, and Eulerian or Hamiltonian cycles. Advanced results may involve Ramsey theory, which states that sufficiently large or dense networks inevitably exhibit certain substructures. Extremal combinatorics investigates maximum or minimum properties of combinatorial objects subject to constraints, while design theory examines balanced configurations of subsets with prescribed intersection properties, known as block designs. Together, these areas emphasize constructive arguments, double counting, combinatorial identities, and algorithmic methods that tackle the combinatorial explosion of possibilities in discrete mathematics.

Geometry covers the study of shape, size, distance, angles, and relative positions of figures. In classical Euclidean geometry, the cornerstone is the set of postulates attributed to Euclid, driving theorems such as the ones explaining triangle angle sums, circle theorems, and properties of similar or congruent figures. Non-Euclidean geometries, like hyperbolic and elliptic systems, arise by modifying Euclids parallel postulate, revealing that line geometry can vary drastically when curvature or other constraints are introduced.

Analytic geometry provides a powerful bridge by using coordinates to represent points in a plane or space, translating geometric problems into algebraic equations. Lines and conic sections, for instance, are defined by polynomials in x and y, while transformations like rotations and reflections can be captured through matrix multiplication. Projective geometry extends the plane by adding points at infinity, turning parallel lines into intersecting lines in an augmented geometric framework and simplifying certain incidence theorems. Differential geometry investigates curves, surfaces, and manifolds using the language of calculus, employing concepts like tangent spaces, curvature, and geodesics. This deeper understanding of geometry undergirds the study of modern physics, manifold theory, and topological properties that remain invariant under continuous deformations. Automated theorem proving in geometry might verify concurrency or collinearity or apply coordinate-based computations to confirm classical results like Cevas theorem.

Logic is the rigorous study of valid reasoning and formal languages used to describe mathematical statements. Propositional logic deals with formulas constructed from propositional variables using logical connectives such as and, or, not, implies, and equivalences like if and only if. These formulas evaluate to true or false and can be manipulated into normal forms like conjunctive normal form or disjunctive normal form, aiding in the process of determining tautologies, contradictions, or satisfiable statements. Satisfiability solvers for propositional logic form the backbone of many automated reasoning tools, particularly in computer science.

First-order logic, also called predicate logic, extends propositional logic by introducing quantifiers, such as there exists and for all, as well as predicate and function symbols that capture relationships between objects in a domain. Key results include Godels completeness theorem, which states that a set of first-order sentences is provable exactly when it is true in every model, and the compactness theorem, which says that if a set of formulas is unsatisfiable, then a finite subset is unsatisfiable. The method of resolution provides a mechanical approach to refutation, relying on unification to match terms in clauses. Higher-order logic, meanwhile, raises expressiveness by allowing quantification over predicates, functions, and sometimes sets. This expressiveness comes with increased complexity, but it enables more direct formalizations of complex mathematical statements. Logic remains fundamental to automated theorem proving, model checking, and the formal verification of software and hardware.

Analysis revolves around concepts of limits, convergence, continuity, and the rigorous underpinnings of calculus. Real analysis studies functions defined on the real numbers, where the epsilon-delta definition of limits and continuous functions ensures mathematical rigor in discussing infinitesimal changes. Sequences and series form another core topic, examining whether infinite sums converge or diverge, and under what conditions they converge absolutely or conditionally. Real analysis also addresses uniform convergence of sequences of functions, power series expansions, and an exploration of metric spaces, which abstract the notion of distance.

Complex analysis studies functions of a complex variable, where the concept of complex differentiability or holomorphicity imposes strong conditions that result in powerful theorems. The residue theorem, for instance, enables the evaluation of integrals around poles of meromorphic functions by examining local behavior of singularities. The geometry of the complex plane, featuring analytic continuation and conformal mappings, reveals surprising properties absent from purely real analysis. Measure theory generalizes the notion of length, area, and volume to more complicated subsets of real space, allowing for the development of the Lebesgue integral. This integral better handles pathological examples and underpins modern probability theory and functional analysis. In partial differential equations, one studies solutions to equations involving rates of change across multiple variables, bridging analysis with physics, geometry, and other applied fields.


Graph theory examines structures composed of vertices and edges, where edges capture connections between vertices. Fundamental notions include degrees of vertices, adjacency, and paths, which are sequences of edges linking distinct vertices. Graph connectivity divides a graph into connected components, while bipartite graphs disallow odd cycles. Matchings, especially in bipartite graphs, explore sets of edges without common vertices, connecting to applications in scheduling and network flows. Eulerian paths traverse every edge exactly once, and Hamiltonian cycles traverse every vertex exactly once, each exemplifying different breadths of path-based constraints.

Planar graphs can be drawn on a plane without edges crossing, and Kuratowskis theorem links planarity to forbidden subgraphs. Colorings and the chromatic number measure the minimum number of colors needed to color vertices so that no two adjacent vertices share a color, an area influenced by classical problems like the four color theorem for planar maps. Graph isomorphism, which investigates whether two graphs are structurally the same, forms a central question in complexity theory. Tree-based arguments consider acyclic connected graphs, focusing on counting spanning trees and investigating how trees form simpler backbones for more complex networks. Overall, graph theory provides a combinatorial framework that is pervasive across computer science, discrete optimization, social network analysis, and beyond.


Topology studies the qualitative properties of spaces that remain unchanged under continuous deformations such as stretching or bending, while disallowing tearing or gluing. Basic concepts include open sets, which underlie the definitions of continuity and convergence in topological spaces. Compactness captures the idea of sets that behave like closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space but within the broader spectrum of potentially abstract spaces. Connectedness and path connectedness probe whether sets can be split into disjoint open subsets or if they can be traversed by continuous paths without leaving the set.

Various specialized branches of topology explore different angles. Algebraic topology uses groups and rings to classify topological spaces, employing notions like the fundamental group or homology groups that measure holes in different dimensions. Differential topology focuses on smooth manifolds, where calculus tools apply to glean information about curvature and local or global geometry. Point-set topology, the foundation of modern topology, studies convergence, separation axioms, and continuous functions in great detail, often linking these ideas to the structure of metric spaces and other specialized topological constructs. Topology has far-reaching implications in areas like functional analysis, manifold theory, knot theory, and dynamical systems, illustrating how global qualitative features can drive sophisticated classifications.


Probability theory addresses the analysis of random phenomena and the quantification of uncertainty through measures assigned to events in a probability space. An event is typically defined as a subset of the sample space, and the probability measure assigns a real number between zero and one, capturing the likelihood that an event occurs. When the sample space is finite, probabilities may be as simple as counting favorable outcomes divided by total possible outcomes, but continuous distributions demand integration with probability density functions. Notable probability distributions include the uniform distribution on an interval, the normal (Gaussian) distribution, the exponential distribution, and discrete distributions such as the binomial or Poisson distributions.

Central concepts include independence, which indicates that events do not affect each others probabilities, and conditional probability, which modifies the probability of an event based on additional known outcomes. Expected value or mean provides the average result of a random variable, while variance measures the spread or dispersion around the mean. Important theorems, such as the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem, connect the behavior of independent identically distributed random variables to predictable long-term statistics. In stochastic processes, one studies sequences or families of random variables indexed by time or other sets, leading to models like Markov chains and Brownian motion, both of which have significant applications in fields like finance, physics, and biology.

Category theory unifies and generalizes concepts across mathematics by abstracting structures as objects and structure-preserving maps as morphisms. A category consists of objects, morphisms between these objects, and rules for composing morphisms associatively, along with identity morphisms for every object. Beyond these basic requirements, one studies functors, which map objects and morphisms of one category to another in a way that preserves composition and identities, and natural transformations, which map functors themselves in a consistent manner. Category theory encapsulates many familiar algebraic and topological notions by seeing sets, groups, rings, spaces, and other constructs as objects in categories, with functions or continuous maps as morphisms.

Important categorical concepts include limits and colimits, which generalize ideas like products, coproducts, intersections, and unions. Adjunctions capture pairs of functors that approximate each other in a precise sense, and monads provide a categorical framework for describing computations or structures that incorporate additional context or effects. The language of category theory has become increasingly influential, offering unified treatments of universal properties, representable functors, sheaves in algebraic geometry, and derived categories in homological algebra. By focusing on the relationships and mappings between objects rather than the objects themselves, category theory provides a powerful lens for systematic thinking across diverse areas of mathematics.

Differential equations arise whenever one models phenomena involving rates of change, connecting the derivative or differential of a function to the function itself or related functions. Ordinary differential equations deal with functions of one variable, while partial differential equations address multivariable contexts like heat flow, wave propagation, and fluid dynamics. Solving a differential equation often involves finding a general solution that satisfies initial or boundary conditions imposed by physical or theoretical constraints.

Classical techniques in ordinary differential equations include separation of variables for first-order equations, the method of undetermined coefficients or variation of parameters for linear equations with constant coefficients, and series expansions for more complex scenarios. Stability theory, phase portraits, and qualitative analysis help in understanding long-term behavior or oscillatory properties of solutions. Partial differential equations such as Laplaces equation, the wave equation, and the heat equation highlight fundamental types that appear in physics, engineering, and mathematical biology. Advanced analytical methods, including Fourier transforms, Green functions, and Sobolev spaces, clarify how solutions behave over continuous domains. Numerical methods, such as finite differences or finite elements, facilitate approximations of solutions when closed-form expressions are elusive. Differential equations thus serve as a cornerstone of applied mathematics, linking real-world phenomena to rigorous mathematical formulations.


Model theory studies the relationships between formal languages and their interpretations, known as models. A model is typically a structure in which the symbols and formulas of a formal language are assigned meanings in a way that allows us to evaluate which sentences are true or false. This area of mathematical logic is deeply intertwined with both algebra and set theory, often examining classes of structures that satisfy specified axioms or theories, such as groups, rings, fields, or entirely new abstract frameworks.

Central to model theory is the notion of satisfaction, where we say that a model satisfies a sentence if the interpretation of that sentence in the model is true. One of the fundamental results in classical first-order model theory is the Compactness theorem, which states that if a set of first-order sentences is unsatisfiable, there exists a finite subset of these sentences that is also unsatisfiable. This theorem underlies many nonconstructive proofs in logic and has significant consequences for the existence of models with various properties. Another pillar is Godels completeness theorem, ensuring that semantic entailment in first-order logic aligns with syntactic derivability.

More advanced topics in model theory revolve around categoricity, stability, and definability. Morleys categoricity theorem, for instance, addresses when a complete theory has exactly one model of a given uncountable cardinality, often implying rich structural properties. Stability theory attempts to classify theories based on their dividing lines of complexity, giving rise to the notions of stable, superstable, and omega-stable theories. Definability questions ask which subsets or relations within a model can be described by formulas of the language, linking back to algebraic geometry when investigating definable sets over fields.

A key tool in model theory is the concept of elementary embeddings, or elementary extensions and substructures, which preserve the truth of sentences. Ultraproduct constructions allow one to combine sequences of structures into a new structure, leading to Lośs theorem that describes how truth of formulas is preserved under ultraproducts. These and other methods enable model theorists to create or rule out the existence of models with particular configurations, bridging abstract logic with concrete algebraic and geometric intuition. Because of its general nature, model theory has applications in areas such as the structure of fields with additional operations, analysis of algebraic groups, and differential fields, illustrating how widely it can apply beyond its purely logical origins.

Mathematics is a broad domain that encompasses various areas of study including algebra analysis topology logic and number theory. The formalization of mathematical reasoning is central to automated theorem proving which relies on precise syntactic representations of logical statements. In the TPTP domains problems are categorized into classes such as CNF FOF and THF each corresponding to a specific logical fragment. The formulation of conjectures in first order logic involves predicates functions and quantifiers which establish relationships between elements of a given domain. Axioms define foundational truths from which inference rules derive conclusions.

Algebraic structures such as groups rings and fields play a fundamental role in mathematical reasoning. A group is a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies associativity and has an identity element and inverses. A ring extends this structure by incorporating addition and multiplication while a field further introduces multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements. In number theory prime numbers are a central object of study where a prime is defined as an integer greater than one that has no divisors other than one and itself.

In topology open sets form the basis of continuity and compactness which are key properties studied in analysis. A topological space is defined by a set along with a collection of open sets that satisfy closure properties under union and finite intersection. A function between topological spaces is continuous if the preimage of every open set is open. Compactness generalizes the notion of boundedness and ensures the existence of convergent subsequences in metric spaces.

Mathematical logic is the foundation of proof systems and model theory. A formal system consists of a language with symbols for logical connectives quantifiers variables functions and predicates along with a set of axioms and inference rules. A proof is a finite sequence of formulas where each formula is either an axiom or follows from previous formulas by inference rules. Completeness and soundness are fundamental properties of logical systems. Completeness ensures that every semantically valid statement is provable while soundness ensures that only valid statements can be derived.

Set theory provides a foundational framework for mathematics. A set is a collection of elements and operations such as union intersection and complement define relationships between sets. The power set of a set is the collection of all its subsets. The concept of cardinality extends the notion of size to infinite sets distinguishing between countable and uncountable infinities. The axiom of choice is a fundamental principle in set theory that states that for every collection of nonempty sets there exists a function that selects one element from each set.

Category theory generalizes mathematical structures through objects and morphisms. A category consists of objects connected by morphisms which satisfy composition and identity properties. Functors map objects and morphisms between categories preserving their structure. Natural transformations establish relationships between functors. The concept of adjoint functors provides deep connections between mathematical constructions.

Combinatorics studies discrete structures and counting principles. Graph theory is a major area within combinatorics where graphs consist of vertices and edges. A graph is connected if there exists a path between any two vertices. A tree is a special type of graph with no cycles. Eulerian and Hamiltonian paths study traversal properties of graphs. The pigeonhole principle states that if more objects are placed into fewer containers at least one container must contain more than one object.

Mathematical analysis studies limits derivatives and integrals. A sequence converges to a limit if the terms get arbitrarily close to a fixed value. A function is differentiable if it has a well defined derivative which represents the rate of change. The integral of a function measures accumulated change over an interval. The fundamental theorem of calculus connects differentiation and integration. Fourier analysis studies functions through their decomposition into sinusoidal components.

Probability theory models uncertainty through random variables and probability measures. A probability space consists of a sample space an event space and a probability function that assigns values between zero and one to events. Conditional probability measures the likelihood of an event given that another event has occurred. The law of large numbers states that the average of repeated independent trials approaches the expected value. The central limit theorem establishes that the sum of independent random variables approaches a normal distribution under certain conditions.

Mathematical optimization seeks to find the best solution to a problem given constraints. Linear programming is a fundamental technique for optimization where an objective function is maximized or minimized subject to linear constraints. Convex optimization generalizes this to nonlinear functions where local minima are also global minima. Duality theory provides deep insights into the structure of optimization problems.

Computational complexity classifies problems based on their inherent difficulty. The class P consists of problems that can be solved in polynomial time while NP consists of problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time. The P versus NP problem is a major open question in theoretical computer science. NP complete problems are the hardest problems in NP such that if any NP complete problem is in P then P equals NP.

Automated theorem proving seeks to mechanize logical inference through formal systems. Resolution is a key method for proving theorems in propositional and first order logic. Rewriting systems transform expressions into normal forms simplifying their structure. Decision procedures determine the satisfiability of logical formulas in restricted domains.

Mathematical structures and their interconnections form the foundation of modern scientific reasoning. The rigorous study of logical principles and formal methods continues to shape the development of mathematics and its applications in theoretical and applied domains.

Let p be a logical proof system consisting of axioms and inference rules. Prove that if a formula is derivable in p then it is a logical consequence of the axioms. Show that if p is sound then every theorem of p is valid in every model. Use gödel's incompleteness theorem to conclude that if p is consistent then there exists a true statement that is not provable in p.

Consider an automaton defined by a finite set of states a transition function and an input alphabet. Prove that every regular language can be recognized by a finite state automaton. Show that if a language is accepted by a nondeterministic finite automaton then it is also accepted by a deterministic finite automaton. Use the myhill nerode theorem to conclude that a language is regular if and only if it has a finite number of equivalence classes under the indistinguishability relation.

Let g be an undirected graph and let v be a vertex of g. Prove that the chromatic number of g is at least the size of the largest clique in g. Show that if g is bipartite then its chromatic number is at most two. Use brook's theorem to conclude that if g is connected and not complete then its chromatic number is at most one more than its maximum degree.

Consider a function f from the real numbers to itself. Prove that if f is differentiable and its derivative is always positive then f is strictly increasing. Show that if f is twice differentiable and its second derivative is always positive then f is convex. Use taylor's theorem to approximate f near a given point.

Let k be a number field and let o be its ring of integers. Prove that o is a dedekind domain. Show that every ideal of o factors uniquely into a product of prime ideals. Use the class number theorem to conclude that the number of distinct ideal classes in o is finite.

Consider a system of linear equations with integer coefficients. Prove that if the system has a solution in real numbers then it has a solution in rational numbers.

Use cramer's rule to express the solution of a system of n linear equations in n unknowns in terms of determinants.

Let g be a finite cyclic group of order n. Prove that for every integer k the element g to the power k has order n divided by the greatest common divisor of k and n. Show that the group of units of the integers modulo n is cyclic if and only if n is equal to two four a power of an odd prime or twice a power of an odd prime. Use euler's totient theorem to conclude that if g is a primitive root modulo p then g to the power of euler's totient function of p is congruent to one modulo p.
